# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the mermaid-mint project grows, we need a way to capture and communicate architectural decisions. This helps maintain consistency, provides context for future developers, and creates a historical record of why certain choices were made.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. ADRs will be stored in `docs/adr/` as numbered markdown files following a standard template.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Architectural decisions are documented and discoverable
- New team members can understand the reasoning behind design choices
- Decision rationale is preserved even as team members change
- ADRs become part of the codebase and are version controlled

### Neutral
- Remember to ask Claude to create ADRs as needed
